## Prerequisites
Before you begin, you'll need the following:

* .NET Standard 2.0 or 2.1, or .NET Core 6.0 installed on your machine
* An IDE such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or JetBrains Rider
* A database to query against (if using the reading package) or write to (if using the writing package)

## Quickstart

To use Raiqub.Expressions in your project, follow these steps:

### Entity Framework Core

1. Install the required NuGet package(s) for the database provider you'll be using, such as **\`Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\`**

2. Install the **\`Raiqub.Expressions.EntityFrameworkCore\`** NuGet package

3. Register your DbContext by using **\`AddDbContextFactory\`** extension method

    ```csharp
    services.AddDbContextFactory<YourDbContext>();
    ```

4. Register the session and session factories using the appropriate extension method(s) for your database provider:

    ```csharp
    services.AddEntityFrameworkExpressions()
        .AddSingleContext<YourDbContext>();
    ```

### Marten

1. Install the **\`Marten\`** NuGet package

2. Install the **\`Raiqub.Expressions.Marten\`** NuGet package

3. Register the session and session factories using the appropriate extension method(s) for your database provider:

    ```csharp
    services.AddMartenExpressions()
        .AddSingleContext();
    ```

### Using

Inject the appropriate session interface (**\`IDbQuerySession\`** for read sessions, **\`IDbSession\`** for write sessions) into your services, and use it read and write from/to database.

You can also create specifications and query strategies. Here's an example of how to create a simple specification:

```csharp
public class CustomerIsActive : Specification<Customer>
{
    public override Expression<Func<Customer, bool>> ToExpression()
    {
        return customer => customer.IsActive;
    }
}
```
And here's an example of how to use the specification:

```csharp
// session is of type IDbSession or IDbQuerySession and can be injected
var query = session.Query(new CustomerIsActive());
var customers = await query.ToListAsync();
```

## Guide

### Creating Specifications

The Specification Pattern is a behavioral design pattern used to encapsulate business rules into composable, reusable and testable objects. This pattern is often used in domains where queries or validation rules need to be expressed in a more readable and maintainable form.

A specification, in the context of this package, is an object that defines a condition that must be satisfied by elements of a certain type. These conditions can be as simple or as complex as needed and are expressed using lambda expressions.

#### Creating a Simple Specification

The **\`Raiqub.Expressions\`** package provides the `Specification<T>` base class for creating specifications. It is optimized to allow ORM frameworks to evaluate and translate it into SQL queries.

Here's a basic example of a specification that checks if a product is in stock:

```csharp
public class ProductIsInStock : Specification<Product>
{
    public override Expression<Func<Product, bool>> ToExpression()
    {
        return product => product.AvailableQuantity > 0;
    }
}
```

#### Creating Specification Factories

You can also create specification factories, which are static classes that provide predefined specifications. Here's an example of a specification factory for products:

```csharp
public static class ProductSpecification
{
    public static Specification<Product> IsInStock { get; } =
        Specification.Create<Product>(product => product.AvailableQuantity > 0);

    public static Specification<Product> IsDiscountAvailable(DateTime now) =>
        Specification.Create<Product>(product => product.DiscountStartDate <= now && now <= product.DiscountEndDate);
}
```

#### Combining Specifications

Specifications can be combined using extension methods or logical operators to create more complex conditions. This flexibility allows you to express intricate business rules concisely. Here are examples of combining specifications for incidents:

```csharp
    public static Specification<Incident> IsClosed { get; } =
        Specification.Create<Incident>(incident => incident.Status == IncidentStatus.Closed);

    public static Specification<Incident> IsResolved { get; } =
        Specification.Create<Incident>(incident => incident.Status == IncidentStatus.Resolved);

    // =======================
    // Using extension methods
    // =======================
    public static Specification<Incident> IsNotResolved { get; } =
        IsResolved.Not();

    public static Specification<Incident> IsResolvedOrClosed { get; } =
        IsResolved.Or(IsClosed);

    // =======================
    // Using logical operators
    // =======================
    public static Specification<Incident> IsNotResolved { get; } =
        !IsResolved;

    public static Specification<Incident> IsResolvedOrClosed { get; } =
        IsResolved | IsClosed;
```

#### Practical Use Cases

Specifications are valuable for filtering data, composing complex queries, and validating entities against business rules. They are particularly useful when working with Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks, as they can be translated into SQL queries for efficient database operations.

### Creating Query Strategies
The query strategy is based on the Strategy Pattern by defining a strategy for querying the database allowing better concern separation, maintainability and reusability than the repository pattern.

The **\`Raiqub.Expressions.Reading\`** package provides abstractions for creating query strategies. You can create a new query strategy by choosing one of several ways available to implement a query strategy.

#### Single Entity Query
The most common strategy is querying a single entity and for that purpose the interface `IEntityQueryStrategy<TSource, TResult>` was created and its abstract class implementation `EntityQueryStrategy<TSource, TResult>`.

Here's an example of a entity query strategy that filters a list of entities based on a set of conditions:

```csharp
public class GetProductNameQueryStrategy : EntityQueryStrategy<Product, ProductName>
{
    protected override IQueryable<ProductName> ExecuteCore(IQueryable<Product> source)
    {
        return source
            .Where(ProductSpecification.IsInStock)
            .OrderBy(e => e.Name)
            .Select(e => new ProductName { Id = e.Id, Name = e.Name });
    }
}
```

or, you can define only the preconditions:

```csharp
public class GetProductInStockQueryStrategy : EntityQueryStrategy<Product>
{
    protected override IEnumerable<Specification<Product>> GetPreconditions()
    {
        yield new ProductIsInStock();
    }
}
```

or yet, you can create a static class as a provider of query strategies:

```csharp
public static class ProductQueryStrategy
{
    public static IEntityQueryStrategy<Product, ProductName> GetName() =>
        QueryStrategy.CreateForEntity(
            (IQueryable<Product> source) => source
                .Where(ProductSpecification.IsInStock)
                .OrderBy(e => e.Name)
                .Select(e => new ProductName { Id = e.Id, Name = e.Name });
}
```

#### Multiple Entities Query
For the cases where multiple entities need to be queried the interface `IQueryStrategy<TResult>` was created.

You can implement the interface directly, as the example below:

```csharp
public class GetProductNameOfOpenStoreQueryStrategy : IQueryStrategy<ProductName>
{
    public IQueryable<TResult> Execute(IQuerySource source) =>
        source => from product in source.GetSetUsing(ProductSpecification.IsInStock)
            join store in source.GetSetUsing(StoreSpecification.IsOpen) on
                product.StoreId equals store.Id
            orderby product.Name
            select new ProductName { Id = e.Id, Name = e.Name };
}
```

or, can create a static class as a provider of query strategies:

```csharp
public static class ProductQueryStrategy
{
    public static IQueryStrategy<ProductName> GetNameOfOpenStore() =>
        QueryStrategy.Create(
            source => from product in source.GetSetUsing(ProductSpecification.IsInStock)
                join store in source.GetSetUsing(StoreSpecification.IsOpen) on
                    product.StoreId equals store.Id
                orderby product.Name
                select new ProductName { Id = e.Id, Name = e.Name });
}
```

### Creating Query Sessions and Querying Data
To create a query session and query data using a query strategy, follow these steps:

1. Inject an instance of `IDbQuerySessionFactory` into your service or controller.
2. Use the `Create()` method of the `IDbQuerySessionFactory` interface to create a new query session.
3. Call the `Query()` method on the query session, passing in your query strategy or specification instance.
4. Call one of the methods on the resulting `IDbQuery<T>` interface to execute the query and retrieve the results.

```csharp
await using (var session = querySessionFactory.Create())
{
    IDbQuery<Customer> query = session.Query(new CustomerIsActive());
    IReadOnlyList<Customer> customers = await query.ToListAsync();
}
```

### Creating Write Sessions and Writing Data
To create a write session and write data to the database, follow these steps:

1. Inject an instance of `IDbSessionFactory` into your service or controller.
2. Use the `Create()` method of the `IDbSessionFactory` interface to create a new write session.
3. Call the appropriate methods on the write session to perform insert, update, or delete operations on your entities.
4. Call the `SaveChangesAsync()` method on the write session to persist your changes to the database.

```csharp
await using (var session = sessionFactory.Create())
{
    var blog = new Blog { Url = "https://example.com" };
    session.Add(blog);
    await session.SaveChangesAsync();
}
```

### Defining custom SQL query for entity (Entity Framework)
Sometimes, you may need to define custom SQL queries to retrieve entities from the database in Entity Framework. This can be useful when you have complex queries that cannot be easily expressed using the standard LINQ queries. Here are the steps to define a custom SQL query for an entity:

#### Step 1: Create a Custom SQL Provider

To define a custom SQL query, start by creating a class that implements the `ISqlProvider<TEntity>` interface. This interface defines a method, `GetQuerySql()`, where you can specify your custom SQL query.

```csharp
private class BlogSqlProvider : ISqlProvider<Blog>
{
    public SqlString GetQuerySql() => SqlString.FromSqlInterpolated($"SELECT \"Id\", \"Name\" FROM \"Blog\"");
}
```

In this example, we've created a `BlogSqlProvider` class that implements the `ISqlProvider<Blog>` interface and defines a custom SQL query for retrieving blog entities.

#### Step 2: Implement the `GetQuerySql()` Method
Inside your custom SQL provider class, implement the `GetQuerySql()` method. This method should return a `SqlString` instance containing your raw or interpolated SQL query. Customize the query to match your specific requirements and entity structure.

#### Step 3: Register the Custom SQL Provider
To make your custom SQL provider available for dependency injection, you need to register it with your application's service container. You need to register it using the singleton lifetime, as show below:

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<ISqlProvider, BlogSqlProvider>();
```

In this registration, we specify the interface `ISqlProvider` and its corresponding implementation `BlogSqlProvider`. This allows the _Raiqub.Expressions_  to resolve and use your custom SQL provider when needed.

#### Best Practices
- **Keep Queries Simple**: While custom SQL queries provide flexibility, it's essential to keep them as simple and readable as possible. Avoid complex queries that can be hard to maintain.
- **Use Parameters**: If your custom query requires input parameters, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection and improve performance.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Custom SQL queries may bypass some of Entity Framework's built-in protections. Ensure thorough testing to validate the correctness and security of your queries.

### Split queries (Entity Framework)
When working with Entity Framework, you may encounter situations where loading related entities in a single query can lead to a "cartesian explosion". This happens when multiple related entities are included in the query, and the resulting dataset becomes excessively large due to cartesian products, impacting performance.

To mitigate this issue, Entity Framework Core allows you to specify the use of split queries for loading related entities. Split queries separate the loading of each related entity into its own query, preventing the cartesian explosion problem.

You can enable split queries for a specific entity by configuring the query options in your application's service configuration. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
services.AddEntityFrameworkExpressions()
    .Configure<Blog>(options => options.UseSplitQuery = true)
    .AddSingleContext<YourDbContext>();
```

In this example:
- `services.AddEntityFrameworkExpressions()` registers the necessary services for Entity Framework Expressions.
- `.Configure<Blog>(options => options.UseSplitQuery = true)` configures the split query option for the Blog entity. Replace _Blog_ with the entity type for which you want to enable split queries.
- `.AddSingleContext<YourDbContext>()` adds the Entity Framework context to your application.

#### When to Use Split Queries
Split queries are particularly useful when you have large datasets or complex relationships between entities, and you want to optimize performance by avoiding the cartesian explosion issue. However, enabling split queries should be considered on a case-by-case basis, as it may introduce additional database queries.

Keep in mind that using split queries is just one of many performance optimization techniques available in Entity Framework. Careful consideration of your data model, query patterns, and database design is essential for achieving optimal performance.

By configuring split queries when appropriate, you can strike a balance between efficient data retrieval and preventing performance bottlenecks caused by cartesian explosions.

For more information refer to [Single vs. Split Queries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/single-split-queries) article.

### Supported Databases
Currently, Raiqub.Expressions supports the following ORM libraries:
* Entity Framework Core
* Marten

If you need to use another ORM library, you will need to implement your own database session factory and database session implementing **\`IDbSessionFactory\`** and **\`IDbSession\`** interfaces.

## Migration Guide

### Key Changes in 2.0.0
In the Version 2.0.0 release of our library, the `IQueryModel`-related interfaces and classes was renamed to `IQueryStrategy`. These changes are summarized in the table below:

| V1                                       | V2                                          |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| IQueryModel&lt;TResult&gt;               | IQueryStrategy&lt;TResult&gt;               |
| IEntityQueryModel&lt;TResult&gt;         | IEntityQueryStrategy&lt;TResult&gt;         |
| EntityQueryModel&lt;TSource, TResult&gt; | EntityQueryStrategy&lt;TSource, TResult&gt; |
| QueryModel                               | QueryStrategy                               |

We chose to rename these interfaces and classes to use the "Strategy" suffix (`IQueryStrategy`, `IEntityQueryStrategy`, etc.) to better reflect their purpose. This new naming convention aligns with design patterns like the Strategy Pattern, which emphasizes encapsulating algorithms and making them interchangeable.

It's important to note that the `IEntityQueryStrategy` interface now extends the `IQueryStrategy` interface. This hierarchy reflects the relationship between entity-specific query strategies and general query strategies. You can use this inheritance structure to create custom query strategies that build upon the foundation provided by `IQueryStrategy`.
